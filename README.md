A job searching platform using Html and css along with java script 
# üåü DreamJobs India ‚Äì Job Portal Web App

This is a responsive and colorful **Job Portal Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed for users to search, filter, and post jobs with ease. The app features a simple login system using `localStorage`, a dynamic job posting form, and filtering functionality based on job title, job type, and Indian city locations. It provides a front-end-only simulation of how a real-world job portal works, with visual polish including modern UI, company logos, hover effects, and a vibrant design.

The job portal includes three main pages: `index.html` (job listing with filters and search), `login.html` (to simulate user login), and `post-job.html` (to allow logged-in users to post new jobs). The CSS uses gradients, shadows, and rounded corners for an appealing design, while the JavaScript handles login/logout logic, dynamic job rendering, and local data storage. All jobs (both default and user-posted) are stored in the browser using `localStorage`.

To run the project locally, you can open it in **Visual Studio Code**, and launch `index.html` using the **Live Server** extension. Alternatively, you can upload the project to GitHub and host it using **GitHub Pages** for free. To do this, create a new repository on GitHub, push your project using Git commands (`git init`, `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push`), then go to the repository settings, find the **Pages** section, and select the `main` branch with the root folder. GitHub will generate a live URL like `https://your-username.github.io/job-portal/` where your site will be publicly accessible.

This project supports Indian cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune, and Remote jobs. It‚Äôs a perfect front-end-only project for beginners who want to learn about DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI design. While the login form does not validate real users (as there is no backend), it serves as a good example of how localStorage can be used to simulate login sessions and protect pages like the job posting form.

You are welcome to extend the project by integrating a real authentication system using Firebase or a Node.js backend, adding resume upload features, or connecting it to a database for persistent job listings. The code is free to use and modify for personal, educational, or portfolio purposes.
